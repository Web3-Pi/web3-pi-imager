### Modifications
This fork, called **Web3Pi Imager**, extends the functionality of the original project to prepare SD cards for Ethereum node deployment.
The modifications include:
- Customization for Single Mode and Dual Mode device setups.
- Support for execution and consensus clients for Ethereum.
- Enhanced advanced configuration settings.
- Removed support for languages other than English.
- Removed the CLI interface.
- Redesigned the application's UI using QML, restructuring all files into a dedicated `UI` subdirectory and utilizing `StackLayout` with separate subpages.
- Completely overhauled the graphical interface and branding icons.
- Modified the build process for each platform to include appropriate branding, names, and graphics.
- Adjusted the settings interface to align with Web3Pi Image settings.
- Changed the system list fetching mechanism to include only Web3Pi versions from a separate source.
- Disabled the original telemetry for Raspberry Pi Imager.
- Added support for discovering devices on the network by hostname.
